I am a computer scientist and geographer with a focus on autonomous systems, artificial intelligence, and geospatial technology. My work explores the intersection of software development and spatial analysis, particularly in the context of self-driving vehicles, urban environments, and human-technology interactions. I apply principles from control systems, AI, and geographic analysis to develop solutions for autonomous navigation, digital mapping, and interactive web-based research tools.

To address complex technical and geographic challenges, I use a combination of computational modeling, geospatial analysis, and software engineering. My approach includes developing predictive models, control algorithms, and interactive digital platforms that integrate real-world datasets such as sensor networks, satellite imagery, and historical archives.

**Areas of Focus:**
- Autonomous Vehicles & Control Systems
- Web Development & Digital Humanities
- Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
- Urban and Environmental Systems
